@* Created it using add->newItem->Razor View Imports *@
@*  First see the _ViewStart.cshtml
    We Use this file to include the common nameSpaces so we don,t need to write the fully qualified name in
    every View every time we include a file from that nameSpace.

    //There can be many ViewImport files in an appication like we can have various ViewStart files
    //if we create viewImport file in Home folder it will be for all the files inside the Home folder so all the views
    //will use this file not the file that is in "Views" folder as the inner/new file will replace the implementation of outer file.
