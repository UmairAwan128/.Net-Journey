    //we created this file using Add->NewItem->Razor View Start

    //Avoid code duplication to make maintainence of your application easy here we assigned name of layout file inspite of assigning
    //in all files and making code duplication we just assigned here i.e all our files will be using this _layout.cshtml
    //we usually place this in "View" folder. There can be many ViewStart files in an appication as there can be various _layout files
    //e.g for "Home" controller Views we have seperate ViewStart file as that file is inside the Home folder so all Home views
    //will use that file not this one.

    //So all files/Views in the "Views" folder use this file or extends from _Layout.cshtml but if we want that a specific
    //View will have anyother _Layout file so in that file we assign that LayoutView name by creating a variable there named "Layout"
    //so that value/layout will be used inspite of this also if we want that a specific view not to have any layout so in that
    //file we assign this "Layout" variable to null

    Layout = "_Layout";

    ////but there will be a case when we want to dynamically select layout page on runtime e.g select either _AdminLayout or _nonAdminLayout
    ////depending on the role of the current user that is loggedIn.
    //if (User.IsInRole("Admin"))
    //{
    //    Layout = "_AdminLayout";
    //}
    //else {
    //    Layout = "_NonAdminLayout"; 
    //}

    ////Code in ViewStart executes before any View extending it
    ////in ViewStart File we can also have the Code which is common in all the files
